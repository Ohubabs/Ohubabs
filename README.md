### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Babatunde. I am a DevOps Engineer & Enthusiast devoted to growing and using my skills to drive business value by speeding/automating the SDLC process for enterprises. I am particularly good with using tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes and Jenkins to provision cloud infrastructure and launch a variety of microservice applications. To showcase my skills and learning process, I have tons of projects that show how to utilize these tools and more to deploy sample applications. Most of these projects are based off recent courses I completed within the past two years in DevOps Engineering and Cloud Computing.
